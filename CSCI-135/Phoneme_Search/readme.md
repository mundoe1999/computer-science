# Phoneme Library Search
This is the second assignment done for Software Analysis and Design I in Spring 2018. Both the original and updated versions of the program are here, so you can test the efficiency of the program

## How to run:
Use g++ to compile either "Phoneme_Library_Search.cpp" or "Phoneme_Library_Search_Alt.cpp". Only one of these files is required to compile.

In order to run, make sure that both executable and "cmudict.0.7a" files are on the same directory.

## What it does
Type an english word into the terminal, and prints out all words that have similar pronunciation to the typed word.

# Resources
These are class assignments / projects from classes that I have already taken but they released a different project 
compared to the semester that I took that course. This is to not only to help code on a more regular basis, but it is
also useful in showing students that I tutor my approach to solving these problems after the assignment is due. This
is a useful resource that can help students learn and be able to tackle future problems differently and more insightfully.
